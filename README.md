## How It Works

### Face Detection
All versions use the Haar Cascade classifier from OpenCV, which is a machine learning-based approach where a cascade function is trained from many positive and negative images. It's particularly efficient for face detection.

### ATM Security System
The security prototype implements a multi-threaded approach:
1. **Camera Thread**: Continuously monitors for faces and security breaches
2. **GUI Thread**: Manages the keypad interface and user interactions
3. **Security Logic**: Coordinates between camera detection and transaction blocking

The basic process for both versions:
1. Captures video from your webcam
2. Converts each frame to grayscale
3. Applies the face detection algorithm
4. Draws rectangles around detected faces
5. Displays the processed frame with face counts and FPS

### Eye Detection (Advanced Version)
The advanced version also uses a Haar Cascade classifier specifically trained for eye detection. For each detected face:
1. A region of interest (ROI) is extracted from the face area
2. The eye detection algorithm is applied to this region
3. Rectangles are drawn around detected eyes

### Screenshots (Advanced Version)
The advanced version allows you to capture screenshots by pressing the 's' key:
1. Screenshots are saved to the 'screenshots' directory (created automatically)
2. Files are named with a timestamp (e.g., 'face_tracker_20230615_120530.jpg')
3. The format can be configured (JPG or PNG)

## Troubleshooting

- If the webcam doesn't open, check that your camera is connected and not being used by another application
- If face detection is not working well, try adjusting the `scale_factor` and `min_neighbors` parameters
- For better performance on slower computers, try reducing the `frame_width` and `frame_height`

## Further Extensions

Some ideas for further extending this application:

- Add face recognition to identify specific people
- Track faces across frames to assign consistent IDs
- Add emotion detection to recognize facial expressions
- Implement facial landmark detection (nose, mouth, etc.)
- Add age and gender estimation
- Create a recording feature to save video
- Implement motion detection to only track when movement occurs
- Add a GUI for adjusting settings without modifying code
